/**
 * SIP Header To. The To header field specifies the desired "logical" recipient
 * of the request, or the address-of-record of the user or resource that is the
 * target of this request. This may or may not be the ultimate recipient of the
 * request. Like the From header field, it contains a URI and optionally a
 * display name. <BR>
 * A request outside of a dialog MUST NOT contain a To tag; the tag in the To
 * field of a request identifies the peer of the dialog. Since no dialog is
 * established, no tag is present. The original recipient may or may not be the
 * UAS processing the request, due to call forwarding or other proxy operations.
 * A UAS MAY apply any policy it wishes to determine whether to accept requests
 * when the To header field is not the identity of the UAS. However, it is
 * RECOMMENDED that a UAS accept requests even if they do not recognize the URI
 * scheme (for example, a tel: URI) in the To header field, or if the To header
 * field does not address a known or current user of this UAS. If, on the other
 * hand, the UAS decides to reject the request, it SHOULD generate a response
 * with a 403 (Forbidden) status code and pass it to the server transaction for
 * transmission.
