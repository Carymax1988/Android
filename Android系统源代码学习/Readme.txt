Building a compatible device is a three-step process:

1.Obtain the Android software source code. This is the source code for the Android platform that you port to your hardware.

2.Comply with the Android Compatibility Definition Document (CDD). The CDD enumerates the software and hardware requirements of a compatible Android device.

3.Pass the Compatibility Test Suite (CTS). Use the CTS as an ongoing aid to compatibility during the development process.
