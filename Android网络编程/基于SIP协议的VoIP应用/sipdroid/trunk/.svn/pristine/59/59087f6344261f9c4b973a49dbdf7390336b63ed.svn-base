/**
 * SIP Header Call-ID. The Call-ID header field acts as a unique identifier to
 * group together a series of messages. It MUST be the same for all requests and
 * responses sent by either UA in a dialog. It SHOULD be the same in each
 * registration from a UA. <BR>
 * In a new request created by a UAC outside of any dialog, the Call-ID header
 * field MUST be selected by the UAC as a globally unique identifier over space
 * and time unless overridden by method-specific behavior. <BR>
 * Use of cryptographically random identifiers in the generation of Call-IDs is
 * RECOMMENDED. Implementations MAY use the form "localid@host". Call-IDs are
 * case-sensitive and are simply compared byte-by-byte.
