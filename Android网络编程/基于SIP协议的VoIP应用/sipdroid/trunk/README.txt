	- Mjsip
	  contributing the original stack,
	  packages org.zoolu.* and where Copyright noted
	
	- Hughes Systique Corporation
	  initial port and development of a Test SIP Client to Google's Android Platform,
	  packages org.sipdroid.* where Copyright noted
	
	Then the Sipdroid Open Source project began with porting to an actual phone,
	the Android Developer Phone 1, and testing basic calls. Therefore also patches to
	the Android Frameworks have been submitted.
	
	As Copyright noted, mostly modules in org.sipdroid.ui.* have been added to
	fully integrate the Client into Android's built-in dialer such as the standard UI
	can be used to initiate calls or ring.
	
	Work has begun to add features like putting calls on-hold, muting, sending DTMF,
	and handing-off between networks.
